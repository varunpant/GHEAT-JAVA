GHEAT JAVA [JAVA HEAT MAPS]
---------------

This is a Java port of [gHeat](http://code.google.com/p/gheat/)

  - This port was primarily inspired by [GHeat-NET](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/88956/GHeat-NET)
  - This is fast and a free heat mapping tool.

Source can be compiled using maven and there is a jetty web application included as well.

**To run start App.java in heatmaps module and then open test.html**

 The application can use FileDataSource,or an in memory **Quadtree** datasource which needs a csv file with weight,latitude and longitude in it or a Postgis data source .

**For Postgis data**

>Change the query to work with custom data ,notice the required aliases( **latitude**,**longitude**,**geom** and **weight** ).

>SELECT ST_X(geom) as **longitude**,ST_Y(geom) as **latitude**, weight as **weight** from mySpatialTable where **geom** @ ST_MakeEnvelope(?,?,?,?,4326)" or change the source of gheat module for a better and more elegant solution

>To run from **command line**,one can issue **mvn clean install** from JavaHeatMaps folder.

>Then in **App.java** file,provide full path to **res** folder,eg:(ThemeManager.init("/full/path/to/res/folder")) and then type **java -jar heatmaps-1.0.jar**

>Open test.html to see the heatmaps overlayed ;).

**Here are some screen shots**
